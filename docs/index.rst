Welcome to CompaCt's documentation!
===================================

`CompaCt`_ performs automated integrative comparative analysis of large-scale 
(protein) interaction datasets, identifying groups of interactors (e.g., protein complexes)
in parallel in multiple species, allowing systematic identification and comparison of 
conserved as well as taxon-specific components of protein complexes and other interactions.
